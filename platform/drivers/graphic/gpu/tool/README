sfss is a tool running at pc host, it acta as a file system  stub server for the target system.
it trans files bettwen target and host system. The images for gpu test are located at the host
file sytem dirs , these files can not put into target storage space under some conditions.

build step:
sfss build from sfs_srv.c

# g++ sfs_srv.c -g -lm -lpthread -o sfssb


usage:

sfss  /dev/ttyS0  921600  testcase_img_dir

2. raw2raw
rawtoraw is a tool used to scale rawfile into a new rawfile with the scale_rate,
raw file format is defined by gpu test program. it is useful with less memory target

build step:
sfss build from rawtoraw.c
# g++ -c -std=c++11 rawtoraw.c  -I/usr/local/include/opencv4 -lm -lopencv_core  -o raw2raw


usage:

raw2raw newrawname rawfile  scale_rate


3. raw2fb
rawtofb is a tool used to write rawfile into a fbfile with the scale_rate,
raw file comes from gpu test program

build step:
rawtofb build from rawtofb.c

# g++ -c -std=c++11 rawtofb.c  -I/usr/local/include/opencv4 -lm -lopencv_core  -o raw2fb

usage:
   rawtofb fbfilename rawfile  scale_rate



4. raw2png
rawtopng is a tool used to write rawfile into a png format file,

raw file comes from gpu test program.

build step:
raw2png build from rawtopng.c
# g++  rawtopng.c  -I/usr/local/include/opencv4 -lm -lopencv_core  -lpng -o raw2png

usage:
   raw2png pngfilename rawfile

5. fb2bmp
fb2png is a tool used to write fbbits file into bmp formated image file,
fbbits file is the screan fb memory dump file.

build step:
fb2bmp  build from fbtobm.c

# g++ -c -std=c++11 fbtobm.c  -I/usr/local/include/opencv4 -lm -lopencv_core  -o fb2bmp

usage:
   fb2bmp bmpfilename fbbitsfile width height  colorbits

6. fb2png
fb2png is a tool used to write fbbits file into png formated image file,
fbbits file is the screan fb memory dump file.


build step:
fb2png  build from fbtopng.c

g++  fbtopng.c  -I/usr/local/include/opencv4 -lm -lopencv_core -lpng -o fb2png

usage:
   fb2png pngfilename fbbitsfile width height

7. cvshow
cvshow is a tool used to show image files(png,bmp)

build step:
cvshow  build from cvshow.c
g++ -c -std=c++11 cvshow.c  -I/usr/local/include/opencv4 -lm -lopencv_core  -o cvshow

usage:
   cvshow  image_filename


NOTE: raw2png supports ABGR8888 color format only currently
